# Tailwind CSS Flexbox Width Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS width classes don't behave as expected when used with flexbox.  The expected behavior is for two divs to each occupy half of their parent's width. However, the divs overlap. The solution demonstrates how to fix this issue.
